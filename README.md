The following steps are performed in the code:

The display format settings are configured using SET commands, such as LINESIZE, PAGESIZE, and COLUMN formats.
A SQL query is executed to retrieve the required data from the tables.
The query calculates the average, minimum, and maximum prices for each category by joining the BRT_CATEGORY and BRT_PRODUCT tables and grouping the results by category.
The results are formatted using the specified column formats.
The final report is displayed in the SQL command line interface.
Output
The executed code generates a dynamic report in the SQL command line interface. The report displays the category name, average price, minimum price, and maximum price for each category. The results are sorted by the average price in ascending order.
